# SELF DRIVING CAR NANODEGREE PROJECT 3

## FORWARD
I would like to recognize Vivek Yadav, the Slack channel, Udacity SDCND forums and posts on medium.com for providing me
ideas for models, image processing and identifying pitalls. Without these resources I would not have been able to complete 
the project.

## OVERALL APPROACH

## IMAGE PREPROCESSING

## TRAINING DATA

## NEURAL NETWORK STRUCTURE

## OTHER CHANGES


## TESTING AND VALIDATION
I tested the network at 3 resolutions that my computer could handle (640x480, 800x600, 960x720). The youtube video below shows the
car successfully navigating the track in all 3 cases
